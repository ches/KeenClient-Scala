 * A BatchWriterClient is a [[Client]] specialized with the capability to write

 *
 * Each instance creates a threadpool and schedules flush operations on it, which
 * will make bulk write calls to the Keen IO API for batches of events until the
 * queue is drained.
 *
 * Events are queued for batch submission with [[queueEvent]]; other operations
 * like [[addEvent]] function as with an ordinary `Client with Writer`â€”that is,
 * they are non-blocking but effect discrete API calls per invocation.
 *
 * Batch size, flush scheduling, queue bounds, etc. can be tuned via the settings
 * under the `keen.queue` property tree.
 *
 * TODO: explain the difference in behavior if send-interval is zero seconds.
 *
 * @param config Client configuration, by default loaded from `application.conf`.
